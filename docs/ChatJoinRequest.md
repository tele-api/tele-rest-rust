# ChatJoinRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**chat** | [**models::Chat**](Chat.md) |  | 
**from** | [**models::User**](User.md) |  | 
**user_chat_id** | **i32** | Identifier of a private chat with the user who sent the join request. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier. The bot can use this identifier for 5 minutes to send messages until the join request is processed, assuming no other administrator contacted the user. | 
**date** | **i32** | Date the request was sent in Unix time | 
**bio** | Option<**String**> | *Optional*. Bio of the user. | [optional]
**invite_link** | Option<[**models::ChatInviteLink**](ChatInviteLink.md)> |  | [optional]
