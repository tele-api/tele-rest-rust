To do this, it displays a 'Connect your YouTube account' button above the results, or even before showing any. The user presses the button, switches to a private chat with the bot and, in doing so, passes a start parameter that instructs the bot to return an OAuth link. Once done, the bot can offer a [*switch\\_inline*](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#inlinekeyboardmarkup) button so that the user can easily return to the chat where they wanted to use the bot's inline capabilities.
